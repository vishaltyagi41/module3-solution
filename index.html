  <h4>Sweets</h4
  <p>Other types include, Kaju Barfi which has course ground cashew nuts as a topping on or in the sweet; Pista Barfi which has course ground pistachios in it; Besan Barfi which is made using gram flour along with the rest of the ingredients; Khoya Barfi which is made using buffalo milk, Generally, because they contain too much sugar, especially white sugar, and too much fat, especially clarified butter. The only thing that can be compared on this level is chocolate, but cocoa is slightly bitter so the sweet taste is somehow tempered.</p>
